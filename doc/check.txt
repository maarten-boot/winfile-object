# WHAT AND HOW TO CHECK

[FILE DATA]

BLOCKNR.DB (A)
	type: DB_File: BTREE
	key: dir2id,filename,block# 
	value: block_digest

BLOCKS.DB (B)
	type: DB_File: BTREE
	key: block_digest
	value: a_comppressed_block

to reconstruct a file read each key from A	
verify that the block numbers are increasing without gaps
verify that there is a coresponding block in B with the digest found in A
so A -(digest)-> B
