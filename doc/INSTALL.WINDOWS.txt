THE WINDOWS INSTALLATION NOTES
==============================

[CONTEXT]

	tested and developed on WIN2000-Professional (English and Dutch)
	Known to have problems on W98
	Testing under WIN-XP(sp2)

	ANY OTHER variation of Windows or its namesakes: NOT TESTED


[ NEED FIRST: PERL ]

	USED DURING DEVELOPMENT: ActivestatePerl 5.6.1 (638)
	+	DB_File

	VERIFIED: ActivestatePerl 5.8.4 (810)
	+ 	DB_File

	Install activeperl on your machine and add the extra modules using PPM
	start a command window , type in PPM and the PPM> prompt should appear,
	do:

	PPM> install DB_File

	to install DB_File from the repository of active state
	(if you are behind a firewall you may have to set a proxy first)


[ NEED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE: WINFILE ]
	Setup your environmanet using My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System variables

	use New

	Enter in the Variable field: WINFILE
	Enter in the Variable Value field: <Your Path for the DB files>

	( f:\winfile in my case )

	OK it and close the Properties window with OK

	see if it worked by starting a cmd window
	type set by itself like:

	c:\> set

	and see if you now have a new Environment variable called WINFILE

	now create %WINFILE/DB with:

	cd %WINFILE
	mkdir DB
	exit

	NB!:
	the %WINFILE%\DB directory holds the database of all the meta data
	and the compressed datablocks so you want plenty of space here
	The %WINFILE% directory and all of its contents will be autoskipped during the backup runs.

	NB!:
	this could be a USB 2 or Firewire disk for offline backup
	Be sure to mount the disk first before running any incrementals
	( usb 1 is not advised for the first backup run, but for subsequent runs should be OK )

	NB!:
	!!YOU CANNOT BACKUP YOUR ACTIVE WINFILE-DB WITH WINFILE!!


[UNPACK ZIPFILE]

	unpack the zip file in a suitible location on your machine
	you yourself may determine where that is.
	(this can be in %WINFILE% but MUST_NOT be in the DB directory)
	lets say you install it in x:\Programs\Winfile-0.1

	cd x:
	cd \Programs
	mkdir Winfile-0.1
	( copy the zip file here)
	unzip Winfile-Object.zip


[ FIRST CONTACT ]

	thats it you can now start your first backup run with:

	perl winfile.pl >first.txt

	or with

	b1.bat

	Under normal cases there should be a start and end time on STDERR and no other errormessages

	There are 3 Globals that have a major impact on the program

	$::TEST , $::VERBOSE and $::DEBUG or $::DBG

	If $::TEST is not 0 then only the first detected volume is backupped
	( in my case that is C: )

	If $::VERBOSE is not 0 some diagnostic messages about visited Directories and Files appear
	but this should have a minimal effect on the speed of the program.

	If $::DBG or $::DEBUG is not 0 massive amounts of internal diagnostics are send to STDERR and STDOUT.
	This will seriously impact the speed of the program and will produce many megabytes of diagnostic data
	It is only needed for serious bug finding if nothing else helps.

	On my work machine (350Mhz,265Mb,7200rpm scsi disk, database on seperate disk )
	the first run of only the C: volume with 3 GB on it takes 1 hour approximately.
	It creates a database of 1 GB out of that.

	On my home machine (600Mhz,512Mb, IDE disk, database on seperate disk )
	the first run of only the C: volume with 3 GB on it takes 30 minutes hour approximately.
	It creates a database of 1 GB out of that.

	after that you can start an incremental by running winfile again:

	perl winfile.pl >incr.txt

	The increamental runs in several minites if nothing changed much on your system and
	may run significantly longer proportional to the amount of changed or added data.

	for for a check run, do:

	perl check.pl >check.txt

	The check program will actually check the internal consistency of the databases  only
	so as to serve as a basis for further test programs.

	the b1.bat will do the first tests with creating a separate text file for each run.
	Just running the b1.bat file runs a backup , a check another backup followed by a second check
	for initial diagnostics
